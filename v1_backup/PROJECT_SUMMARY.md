# 🚀 Data Chat Interface - Project Summary

## What We Built

A complete conversational interface for exploring data catalogs and querying data using **Atlan** and **Snowflake**. Users can ask questions in natural language and get intelligent responses with charts and visualizations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`app.py`** - Main Streamlit web application
   - Chat interface with message history
   - Sidebar with connection status and example queries
   - Integration of all components

2. **`atlan_client.py`** - Atlan Integration
   - Wraps MCP tools for Atlan API calls
   - Handles asset search, glossary terms, lineage
   - Falls back to mock data for development
   - Uses actual MCP tools: `mcp_atlan_search_assets_tool`, `mcp_atlan_traverse_lineage_tool`, `mcp_atlan_update_assets_tool`

3. **`query_processor.py`** - Intent Detection & Routing
   - Analyzes user queries using regex patterns
   - Routes to appropriate handlers based on intent
   - Supports: definitions, asset usage, data queries, charts, table search

4. **`snowflake_client.py`** - Data Querying & Semantic Models
   - Connects to Snowflake for data queries
   - Creates Cortex Analyst semantic models
   - Generates SQL from natural language requests

5. **`chart_generator.py`** - Visualization Engine
   - Creates interactive Plotly charts
   - Auto-detects best chart type from data
   - Supports: bar, line, pie, scatter, histogram, box plots

## 🎯 Supported Workflows

### 1. Glossary Term Definitions
**User**: "How is Customer Acquisition Cost defined?"
**System**: 
- Searches Atlan glossary for the term
- Returns definition, examples, usage
- Offers follow-up options

### 2. Asset Discovery
**User**: "Which assets use the term 'revenue'?"
**System**:
- Finds glossary term GUID
- Searches for assets tagged with that term
- Lists assets with descriptions and locations

### 3. Data Exploration (Single Query)
**User**: "Show me total revenue last year"
**System**:
- Finds relevant tables (e.g., Financial Data Providers, Orders)
- Asks user to choose table
- User selects "single query"
- Executes SQL query and shows results
- Optionally creates visualization

### 4. Data Exploration (Multiple Queries)
**User**: "I want to analyze sales data"
**System**:
- Finds relevant tables
- User selects table and chooses "multiple questions"
- Creates Cortex Analyst semantic model with metadata
- Enables natural language queries on the semantic model

### 5. Chart Creation
**User**: "Create a bar chart of sales by region"
**System**:
- Identifies data requirements
- Executes appropriate query
- Auto-generates suitable visualization
- Allows chart type customization

## 🔧 Query Intent Detection

The system recognizes these patterns:

- **Definitions**: "What is...", "How is...defined?", "Define..."
- **Asset Usage**: "Which assets use...", "Where is...used?"
- **Data Queries**: "Show me...", "Get...from...", "Total...", "Average..."
- **Charts**: "Create...chart", "Visualize...", "Plot..."
- **Table Search**: "What tables...", "Find tables..."

## 🎨 Chart Intelligence

Auto-detects optimal chart types:
- **Time series data** → Line charts
- **Categories + Numbers** → Bar charts
- **Proportions** → Pie charts
- **Correlations** → Scatter plots
- **Distributions** → Histograms/Box plots

## 🔄 Mock Data System

For development and testing, includes:
- Sample glossary terms (Customer Acquisition Cost, Annual Revenue)
- Mock tables (Instacart Products, Orders, Financial Data)
- Realistic data structures matching Atlan schema

- Natural language to SQL conversion

## 📊 Example Interactions

### Glossary Lookup
```
User: "How is Customer Acquisition Cost defined?"
Assistant: "Customer Acquisition Cost: The cost associated with acquiring 
           a new customer, including marketing, sales, and onboarding expenses.
           
           Examples: If you spend $100 on marketing and acquire 10 customers, 
           your CAC is $10.
           
           🔍 Follow-up options:
           • Ask 'Which assets use Customer Acquisition Cost?' to see where 
             this term is applied"
```

### Data Query with Choice
```
User: "Show me annual revenue from last year"
Assistant: "I found multiple tables that might contain the data you're looking for:

           1. Financial Data Providers (Snowflake)
           📝 Financial metrics and KPIs aggregated by provider
           
           2. Orders (Snowflake)  
           📝 Customer order transactions
           
           Please let me know which table you'd like to use..."
```

## 🛠️ Extensibility

### Adding New Query Types
1. Add patterns to `QueryProcessor.patterns`
2. Create handler method `_handle_new_type()`
3. Update routing in `process_query()`

### Adding New Chart Types
1. Add method to `ChartGenerator`
2. Update `chart_types` mapping
3. Add detection patterns

### Adding New Data Sources
1. Create new client class (similar to `SnowflakeClient`)
2. Update `QueryProcessor` to route appropriately
3. Add connection management to main app

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production

1. **Real Atlan Connection**: Configure actual API tokens
2. **Snowflake Setup**: Connect to real data warehouse
3. **Advanced NLP**: Integrate OpenAI for better query understanding
4. **Caching**: Add Redis for query result caching
5. **Authentication**: Add user management and permissions
6. **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
7. **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and user feedback
